In modern times, people rely heavily on the weather forecast to make sure their schedule is not affected by the weather. And people also relied heavily on notepad to organise their lives, and many people have a very large number of them in their phones. So I wanted to make a weather forecasting app that integrated a notepad.

Functional Requirements:

* The app will provide weather forecast information.✓  ps:About the Air quality part,because the API don't have the information of all the cities,so some of the city is null.
* The app will change different wallpapers according to the current weather.✓
* The app will allow you to add, edit and delete note.✓
* The app will allow you to add monitoring cities manually.✓

NonFunctional Requirements:

* The app will not show Ads. ✓
* The app will not collect user information.✓
